TODO
====

- horizontal scrolling
- vertical scroll bar shows percentage of the view area
- temporarily set editable to false and do copy() in a background thread (with an error handler) if the model is large
- focused border
- highlight current line
- model: create leading component
- model: has leading component
- model: highlighters
- model: get side bar highlights


FIX
===
- #1 fix LTR+RTL selection
- empty model shows no caret
- click outside of text should move caret to the last character
